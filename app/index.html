      			<p>I'm an experienced Android developer with previous experience in Java backend development with 6+ years as a Java developer and 5 years in Android.</p>
      			<p>I'm a big fan of Material design and not a stranger to actually implementing it in real apps. I've also released two Android Material libraries on GitHub (+ some other stuff).</p>
      			<p>I love writing GOOD unit tests (integration and UI tests as well).</p>
      			<p>I would describe myself as a fun person to hang out with and I always bring good humour to the team I'm working in.</p>
      			<p>On a more personal level, I'm a loving husband with a passion for photography, travelling (I ❤️ Australia) and cooking.</p>
